# Dave's Neovim configuration
### credits to Vhyrro

This is a permanent copy of my neovim set up.  I have been watching Vhyrro's Youtube playlist for Neovim to create it.

I may have slight differences between mine and his, but it does work, or did when I put it here.

On Linux, clone it into .config folder.  On Windows, clone it into c:\users\your-username\appdata\local\

Use at your own risk.
